Jupiter ACE emulator on iOS.

The Jupiter ACE is the real *outsider* micro from the 80's. Instead of having [BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC) as the programming language it had [FORTH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_programming_language). It was designed by two former employees at Sinclair Research Ltd who were responsible for the famous [Sinclair ZX81](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zx81) and [ZX Spectrum](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum). They are Steven Vickers and Richard Altwasser. For a FAQ see [here](http://www.robsons.org.uk/archive/users.aol.com/autismuk/ace/faq.htm)

The Jupiter ACE wasn't very successful, though it had some very interesting characteristics.

This project comes out of an old little project I put together back in 1999. I made a very simple Jupiter ACE emulator with pieces from various other open source project. I had almost forgotten about the project but in 2010  Lawrence Woodman started to work on it and he started to clean things up and add new features. That project is [here](https://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/xAce). He has also taken it further and is now cutting out old things like X11 and use more portable things like SDL, that project is [here](https://github.com/LawrenceWoodman/CanAce).

Later I saw that over at [www.jupiter-ace.co.uk](http://www.jupiter-ace.co.uk) they had digitized the manuals. Today I work with iOS development and I thought; why not bundle the emulator and the manual in one app? Said and done, here is the source code and you can also get it at the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id590389822)

Share and enjoy!<br>
